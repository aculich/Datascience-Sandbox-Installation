# Datascience Sandbox Server Installation
Collection of scripts and configuration files to quickly setup a Datascience **sandbox server** to learn/experiment with Big Data and Machine Learning / Deep Learning softwares (including **Tensorflow with support for the latest Nvidia Pascal GPU GTX1080**)


## Introduction

As I am learning/experimenting with Big Data and Machine Learning, I sometimes need to quickly setup/clone/restore a sandbox server with some various Data Science softwares. This collection of scripts/configurations files is intended to facilitate/automate this task. You can use it "as this", modify it to suit your project's requirements or simply get directions from it for a manual server installation.

This script has been developped/tested with the very great **Innovation Lab Projet #1521** proposed by **OVH** (see https://www.runabove.com/index.xml) which consists in a dedicated server with the following configuration : 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630v3 (16 cores each / 32 cores in total), 128GB of RAM, 240 GB of SSD, 1 Nvidia GTX 1080 

## What it does :

From a fresh installation of Ubuntu,

- update ubuntu, setup a firewall, create a user, ...
- provide an option to setup a **Nvidia Pascal GTX1080** on Ubuntu 14.04 (Install drivers + cuda 8.0) 
- provide an option to install (compile sources) **Tensorflow r0.10 (with or without Nvidia GPU support)** 
- provide an option to install **Torch** 
- provide an option to install **Hadoop 2.7 / Spark 2.0** as a Mono-cluster
- install some tools like x2go server to be able to open program like Firefox or R Studio through a ssh remote connection
- provide an option to install **R and R Studio Desktop** 
- provide an option to install miniconda 

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (with original kernel 3.13.0-95)
* If you want to setup the Nvidia graphic card, you will have to download the following softwares from Nvidia website (you might need to register a free account and enroll to some Nvidia free developpers programs ). Note, these versions are the latest available at the time of writing these scripts : 
   * NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.44.run* (see :http://www.nvidia.com/drivers )
   * cuda_8.0.27_linux.run* (see : https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-release-candidate-download  )
   * cuda_8.0.27.1_linux.run* (see : https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-release-candidate-download )
   * cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v5.1.tgz (see : https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn )

* The *setup-server.sh* script and *install* directory (and its content)  needs to be installed in the */root* directory (Make sure the *.run* scripts are executable (*chmod u+x *.run*))
   *  *setup-server.sh* is the main installation script. You will be prompted to create a user login to work with the sandbox
   *  the *install* directory contains aditional scripts and configuration files to be restored/installed
   *  Optional / Not available in this github repository : you can create a *install/perso* sub-directory wher you can store your own archive of *.ssh/* directory for your 'default' user login if you want to later automate the restoration of your ssh keys for that user. If no */root/install/perso/ssh.tar* archive exists, the script will generate new ssh keys for the new user login being created by the script, otherwise it will restore its keys from that tar archive). 
       

   *  Optional / Not available in this github repository : if your server has a *Nvidia graphic card (the script is written for the GTX1080)*, you can create a */root/install/nvidia* directory to downaload/store the required Nvidia installers  described abobe so that the installation script can find them.

Note : The installation script will install x2go server and Firefox. You can use x2goclient from your remote connection to launch Firefox (specific app */usr/bin/firefox* , you do not have to launch a full X windows desktop) to make it easier to download the Nvidia softwares after login to the Nvidia website, accept the conditions of utilisations and programs registration. This is also usefull to access the Hadoop/Yarn/Spark admin pages without opening them on the firewall. All the more, if you want to execute R Studio on the server you will need to use it through x2go client too. See http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start in order to  download/install the x2go client


## Usage : setup a Datascience sandbox

```shell
/root/setup-server.sh [options]
```
You can use the following installation parameters : 

```shell
    --notensorflow    to skip TensorFlow installation
    --nocudagpu       to disable NVidia driver and cuda installation 
    --notorch         to skip Torch installation 
    --nohadoop        to skip Hadoop/Yarn/Spark installation
    --nor             to skip R and Rstudio installation
    --conda           to install miniconda 
    --help            to display this help menu  
```
The script requires to be executed by the root user. 

By default, without any options, the setup script will install Hadoop/Spark, Nvidia GTX1080 support, Tensorflow (with GPU support), Torch (which benefits form GPU too) and R softwares

For example, if you only want to only setup the server with Tensorflow with GPU support : 
```shell
/root/setup-server.sh --notorch --nohadoop --nor
```

When new version of the softwares will be available, you should be able to use them by updating a few variables at the begining of the *setup-server.sh* script

Once installed, you can remove the *setup-server.sh* and *install/* directory (and contents)


## Limitations

This script has been developped for Ubuntu 14.04 It has not been tested on other version/linux flavors
(I did not choose Ubuntu 16 because there are issues with x2go for the moment)

**The installation script was not designed/intended to setup a production server** : it just aims to setup a development sandbox (that suits my needs). All the more installing Haddop on a single node does not make any sense apart from learning Hadoop in a sandbox (Eventually, you can consider installing Spark without Haddop, as this kind of OVH server has many cores/lots of RAM). Anyway you can clone/use/adjust/correct/complete this script if you find it usefull for your needs.

The installation script is not intended to be executed several times (like to update a previous setup). Though it should work in most cases properly, not every cases have been tested. So if you want to use it after an initial setup, use it with caution at your own risks.


## Note about Nvidia GTX1080 setup and Tensorflow compilation with CUDA option

**The script takes care of everything described below, but in case you would like to install your system manually, here are a couple of usefull things to know** (It took me a little bit of times to figure out them, as it was the first time I installed a Nvidia GPU on Ubuntu, especially with some Nvidia release candidate softwares)

A good starting point for me was this blog post from Nvidia website : http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-accelerated-applications-tensorflow-installation.html

Another good source of information was the TensorFlow website itself : https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html#installing-from-sources

First, you must install the GPU drivers. Some Nvidia drivers exist in Ubuntu repository but you must not install them (*apt-get install nvidia-\* *)  for the moment, as the versions for the Pascal architecture are currently only available from Nvidia website. Mixing the packages installation lead to some faillure when installing the Nvidia drivers (and sometimes the errors are not very visible...) 

you can check that the Nvidia drivers are correctly installed by running this command
```shell
$ nvidia-smi

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
$ 
```

Also prior to installing the Nvidia drivers, the Linux kernel sources (generic) corresponding to the used kernel needs to be installed. 

Then, I met compilation issues in Tensorflow when compiling with the cuda option. I found some tips on the issue here : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/3431#issuecomment-234131699 
So I used awk to patch one Tensorflow source file in order to add the line `cxx_builtin_include_directory: "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include" ` in the file `tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/CROSSTOOL` 

Note that it did not worked if I used the */usr/local/cuda* unix link that points to the actual directory */usr/local/cuda-8.0*

## Usage : how to start/stop Hadoop/Spark mono cluster (if installed)

If you have installed Hadoop/Spark in your Sandbox, you can start / stop  the cluster using the following scripts

```shell
# Start Hadoop  & Yarn
start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh

# Start Hadoop  & Yarn
stop-yarn.sh
stop-dfs.sh

```
Quicklinks to access the Hadoop/Spark admin pages (using Firefox on the server through x2goclient)
   HDFS Admin : http://localhost:50070/
   Yarn Admin : http://localhost:8088/cluster
   Spark Admin (when spark is running) :http://localhost:4040/jobs/



## Things to improve
   * check to replace R Studio Desktop by R Studio Server (may need some SSL certificates)
   * check Nvidia installers checksum in the installation script 
   * replace release candidate versions of Nvidia softwares by stable versions when available
   * Tensorflow installation : improve CROSSTOOL patch to include path to CUDA directory 
   * improve security regarding hadoop/spark admin pages access
   * Possibility to have a post install script to be used in OVH manager when setting up the server ?
   * redirect some install display output to some logs file and have the instalaltion a bit more cleaner at display  
   * add a menu to select what sofwares to install. Improve installatio nscript arguments 
   * Make a VM or Docker image ? (at least without Nvidia software / License for public version ?)
   * ...

There are certainly lots of room for improvements in this installation script (My goal was not to have the perfect script but have a simple way to quickly setup a sandbox server for my needs)
